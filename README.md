# OSINT-Tools
A list of OSINT tools I made, forked, and or use.

# Google dorks

[Google-FU, use google to lookup info on someone or something; may get rate limated](https://github.com/Nthompson096/GoogleFU-improved)

# Biometric investigation

[Facecheck.ID tapermonkey script; improved by yours truly, bypasses the payment requirements and gives you the links](https://github.com/vin3110/facecheck.id-results-extractor)

[Pimeyes image extractor; will give you an idea of where the image was located based on a URL, can use this with facecheck.id](https://github.com/Nthompson096/Pimeyes-Free-POC-GUI)

They also have a [website](https://rgbattack.com/); gives you details on what the image is and everything, seems to be more in detail but will not give you a link to which website sadly so you'll still need to use the above most likely.

# Email + username investigations 

[Blackbird, a robust OSINT tool that facilitates rapid searches for user accounts by username or email across a wide array of platforms](https://github.com/p1ngul1n0/blackbird)

[Sherlock, basically like blackbird but more robust and developed, imgur can give red herrings so be careful on that info](https://github.com/sherlock-project)

[Hudson rock API extractor, for use on emails and usernames; isn't automated but has flask, checks to see if an email was compromised](https://github.com/Nthompson096/hudsonrock-search-extractor)

[holehe, be careful about imgur as it can be a false positive/red herring; reason why I don't use it too much or at all, same with Sherlock](https://github.com/megadose/holehe)

# Curated list

[Awesome OSINT, a curated list of OSINT tools, blogs, videos](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint)

[OSINT Framework, a much bigger list of tools not listed here](https://osintframework.com/)

# Email address + username + name generation:

[Email user/name for cock.li and protonmail, useful for creating an account that isn't on a tempmail service; still need to solve captcha on cock.li](https://github.com/Nthompson096/user-email-gen)

# ***DISCLAIMER: Cock.li may be having issues:***

## Updates:

My fellow retards: cock.li has not "shut down". You may need to read more than the first line.
Anyone suggesting you migrate your account to Gmail, Yahoo, Proton, etc. should not have been using cock.li in the first place. Normalfags get off my fucking board.
Feel free to migrate, I don't have any good suggestions though. Try that on Proton!
PW changes and maybe registration will be back within a couple days.

## Before:

LIBERTY CANARY

Date updated: See the PGP Signed Version

Cock.li is in 100% control of all of its hardware, and the service is still operating normally. The website (account registration+pw change) is currently offline.

Cock.li will shut down before becoming complicit in crimes against its own userbase under duress of any government or organization.

Cock.li is not under duress of any government or organization.

I'd probably recommend using something else other than cock.li; use any domain from cock.li and use a different email server provider, this is stupid.

# OPSEC

Use services that can conceal your identity if you're paranoid
Telegram is kinda normie tier, requires a phone number - simplex isn't too bad and neither is signal. tor isn't bad but will get rate limited by captcha.
Mullvad is pretty good as a VPN considering it accepts XMR (monero) as a form of payment, meaning it can't really be traced back to you if you buy this VPN service and you mine XMR with your own node; also worth noting that VPNS are useles if you have
bad opsec, IE people can find you on people search engines and the like along with using the same variant of a username and or by biometrics.
Use different usernames and creds on different websites, use a word spinner to change sentences on everything if you wanted to conceal your identity (people will google who you really are).
Try not to make much foes and the like and don't be noticeable on the internet (IE; don't be a turd) also don't plaster your face on the net and if you do try to look yourself up on the net.
This is the BEST pieces of advice I can give anyone reading this.
