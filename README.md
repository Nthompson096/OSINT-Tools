# OPSEC

Use services that can conceal your identity if you're paranoid
Telegram is kinda normie tier, requires a phone number - simplex isn't too bad and neither is signal. tor isn't bad but will get rate limited by captcha.
Mullvad is pretty good considering it accepts XMR (monero) as a form of payment, meaning it can't really be traced back to you if you buy this VPN service and you mind XMR with your own node.
Use different usernames and creds on different websites, use a word spinner to change sentences on everything if you wanted to conceal your identity (people will google who you really are).
Try not to make much foes and the like and don't be noticeable on the internet (IE; don't be a turd) also don't plaster your face on the net and if you do try to look yourself up on the net.
This is the BEST pieces of advice I can give anyone reading this.
