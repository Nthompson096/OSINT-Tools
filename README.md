# OSINT-Tools
A list of OSINT tools I made, forked, and or use. First lets talk about the definitions.

## OPSEC

OPSEC, or Operations Security, is a systematic process for:
1. identifying
2. protecting and controlling critical information.

It's a security discipline and operations function that involves a continuous cycle of:
* Identifying critical information and indicators (CII)
* Analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities
* Assessing risks
* Developing countermeasures to protect CII 

OPSEC is used to protect information and activities from adversaries.

It's a warfighting capability that helps identify and protect sensitive information that could give an adversary an advantage. 

OPSEC principles can be applied in daily life, such as not sharing personal information like Social Security numbers.

* Other examples of OPSEC mistakes include:

* Over-sharing personal information online

* Leaving unused social media profiles online

* Accidentally interacting with a target on social media 

OPSEC supplements other security disciplines, rather than replacing them.


## How to OPSEC:

* Use services that can conceal your identity if you're paranoid
Telegram is kinda normie tier, requires a phone number - simplex isn't too bad and neither is signal.

* Tor/VPN/XMR

tor isn't bad but will get rate limited by captcha.
Mullvad is pretty good as a VPN considering it accepts XMR (monero) as a form of payment, meaning it can't really be traced back to you if you buy this VPN service and you mine XMR with your own node; also worth noting that VPNS are useles if you have bad opsec. 

Example people can find you on people search engines and the like along with using the same variant of a username and or by biometrics.

* Usernames/creds/ID

Use different usernames and creds on different websites, use a word spinner to change sentences on everything if you wanted to conceal your identity (people will google who you really are).
Try not to make much foes and the like and don't be noticeable on the internet (IE; don't be a turd) also don't plaster your face on the net and if you do try to look yourself up on the net.
These are the BEST pieces of advice I can give anyone reading this. ***OSINT*** yourself.

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Open source intelligence (OSINT) is the process of gathering, analyzing, and using data from publicly available sources to create actionable intelligence.

## What it is
OSINT is the practice of collecting and analyzing information from public sources to address specific intelligence needs.

## How it's used
OSINT is used by government agencies and commercial organizations for a variety of purposes, including:
- Reconnaissance
- Cyber crime investigations
- Market trend analysis
- Brand positioning analysis
- Measuring risk to an organization
- Understanding the actor, tactics, and targets

## Why it's important
OSINT is important because it allows organizations and individuals to:
- Gather real-time information
- Make informed decisions
- Receive early warnings of potential threats

# Who uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)?

## National Security and Intelligence Agencies
- The CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) all use OSINT.

## Law Enforcement
- OSINT can be used to protect citizens from identity theft, sexual violence, and abuse.

## Businesses
- OSINT can be used to monitor competitors, investigate new markets, and plan marketing activities.

## Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Groups
- OSINT can be used to gather intelligence about a specific target online.

## Privacy-Conscious People
- OSINT can be used to check how outsiders can break into their computing devices.
- OSINT can also be used on oneself to secure privacy.

## Non-Governmental Organizations
- Bellingcat, the Center for Information Resilience, and Oryx are examples of non-governmental organizations that use OSINT.

## Sources of OSINT
OSINT can be used to gather information from a variety of sources, including:
- Public government data
- Professional and academic publications
- Commercial data
- [Grey literature](https://browse.welch.jhmi.edu/c.php?g=1195274)

## Tools
OSINT tools can access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines. One example is **Shodan**, which can examine operational technology (OT) like those used in industrial control systems. Tools I use are discussed here below.

## Google dorks

[Google-FU, use google to lookup info on someone or something; may get rate limated](https://github.com/Nthompson096/GoogleFU-improved)

## Biometric investigation

[Facecheck.ID tapermonkey script; improved by yours truly, bypasses the payment requirements and gives you the links](https://github.com/vin3110/facecheck.id-results-extractor)

[Pimeyes image extractor; will give you an idea of where the image was located based on a URL, can use this with facecheck.id](https://github.com/Nthompson096/Pimeyes-Free-POC-GUI)

They also have a [website](https://rgbattack.com/); gives you details on what the image is and everything, seems to be more in detail but will not give you a link to which website sadly so you'll still need to use the above most likely.

## Email + username investigations 

[Blackbird, a robust OSINT tool that facilitates rapid searches for user accounts by username or email across a wide array of platforms](https://github.com/p1ngul1n0/blackbird)

[Sherlock, basically like blackbird but more robust and developed, imgur can give red herrings so be careful on that info](https://github.com/sherlock-project)

[Hudson rock API extractor, for use on emails and usernames; isn't automated but has flask, checks to see if an email was compromised](https://github.com/Nthompson096/hudsonrock-search-extractor)

[holehe, be careful about imgur as it can be a false positive/red herring; reason why I don't use it too much or at all, same with Sherlock](https://github.com/megadose/holehe)

## Curated list

[Awesome OSINT, a curated list of OSINT tools, blogs, videos](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint)

[OSINT Framework, a much bigger list of tools not listed here](https://osintframework.com/)

## Email address + username + name generation:

[Email user/name for cock.li and protonmail, useful for creating an account that isn't on a tempmail service; still need to solve captcha on cock.li](https://github.com/Nthompson096/user-email-gen)

## ***DISCLAIMER: Cock.li may be having issues:***

## After:

My fellow retards: cock.li has not "shut down". You may need to read more than the first line.
Anyone suggesting you migrate your account to Gmail, Yahoo, Proton, etc. should not have been using cock.li in the first place. Normalfags get off my fucking board.
Feel free to migrate, I don't have any good suggestions though. Try that on Proton!
PW changes and maybe registration will be back within a couple days.

## Before:

LIBERTY CANARY

Date updated: See the PGP Signed Version

Cock.li is in 100% control of all of its hardware, and the service is still operating normally. The website (account registration+pw change) is currently offline.

Cock.li will shut down before becoming complicit in crimes against its own userbase under duress of any government or organization.

Cock.li is not under duress of any government or organization.

I'd probably recommend using something else other than cock.li; use any domain from cock.li and use a different email server provider, this is stupid.
