# OSINT-Tools

A list of OSINT tools I made, forked, and/or use. First, let's talk about the definitions.

***DISCLAIMER***

I am in no way responsible for any abuse, misuse, or any questionable actions in which someone uses these tools or methods below. OSINT is an information-gathering technique that can be used by ANYBODY!

## OPSEC

**OPSEC** (Operations Security) is a systematic process for:
1. Identifying
2. Protecting and controlling critical information

It's a security discipline and operations function that involves a continuous cycle of:
* Identifying critical information and indicators (CII)
* Analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities
* Assessing risks
* Developing countermeasures to protect CII

OPSEC is used to protect information and activities from adversaries. It helps identify and protect sensitive information that could give an adversary an advantage. OPSEC principles can be applied in daily life, such as not sharing personal information like Social Security numbers.

**Examples of OPSEC mistakes include:**
* Over-sharing personal information online
* Leaving unused social media profiles online
* Accidentally interacting with a target on social media

OPSEC supplements other security disciplines rather than replacing them.

### How to OPSEC:

* **Use services that can conceal your identity:**
  - Telegram is normie-tier as it isn't encrypted by default and requires a phone number.
  - Simplex isn't too bad.
  - Signal is encrypted by default but requires a phone number; however signal can't give anything out even by court order [because of state of the art encryption even user accounts and phone numbers](https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/).

* **Tor/VPN/XMR:**
  - Tor isn't bad but will get rate limited by CAPTCHA.
  - Mullvad is a good VPN (Virtual Private Network) as it accepts XMR (Monero), which can't be traced back to you if you mine XMR with your own node. Note: VPNs are useless if you have bad OPSEC, same with Tor.

* **Usernames/credentials/Identification:**
  - Use different usernames and credentials on different websites.
  - Use a word spinner to change sentences for identity concealment.
  - Generate a face or use a non-identifiable profile picture.
  - Avoid making enemies online and don't be noticeable (i.e., don't be a turd).
  - Regularly OSINT yourself to check your online presence.

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

**OSINT** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and using data from publicly available sources to create actionable intelligence.

### What it is:
OSINT is the practice of collecting and analyzing information from public sources to address specific intelligence needs.

### How it's used:
OSINT is used by government agencies and commercial organizations for various purposes, including:
- Reconnaissance
- Cyber crime investigations
- Market trend analysis
- Brand positioning analysis
- Measuring risk to an organization
- Understanding the actor, tactics, and targets

### Why it's important:
OSINT allows organizations and individuals to:
- Gather real-time information
- Make informed decisions
- Receive early warnings of potential threats

## Who uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)?

### National Security and Intelligence Agencies
- The CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) all use OSINT.

### Law Enforcement
- OSINT can protect citizens from identity theft, sexual violence, and abuse.

### Businesses
- OSINT can monitor competitors, investigate new markets, and plan marketing activities.

### Cybersecurity and Cyber-crime Groups
- OSINT can gather intelligence about specific targets online.

### Privacy-Conscious People

## Sources of OSINT
OSINT can gather information from various sources, including:
- Public government data
- Professional and academic publications
- Commercial data
- [Grey literature](https://browse.welch.jhmi.edu/c.php?g=1195274)

### Real world examples of OSINT

- A basket weaving image board used OSINT to pay some terroist a vist from a [govt.](https://imgur.com/pol-helps-coordinate-airstrike-on-moderate-syrian-rebels-N7DwWP1)
    - [A video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR6epSP_Xlw)

TLDR:

In 2016, during the complex Syrian Civil War, various rebel groups, some with good intentions and others with nefarious motives, sought to overthrow President Assad. The chaos allowed terrorist groups to flourish, prompting intervention from the United States and Russia, with the former supporting rebels and the latter aiding Assad.

An anonymous user on 4chan's Syria General board (SG) claimed that a Syrian rebel group, Jaysh al-Izza, posted a video on YouTube revealing their secret encampment. The group, linked to Al-Qaeda, was seen by 4chan users as a target. A notable 4chan user, Ivan Sirenko, who had connections with the Russian military, received the coordinates from the 4chan community and tweeted them to the Russian Ministry of Defense. This led to an airstrike on the encampment.

Two months later, the same rebel group posted another video showing a new training camp. 4chan users once again pinpointed the location using landmarks seen in the video. After thorough verification, they sent the coordinates to Ivan, who facilitated another Russian airstrike.

While 4chan users believed they were targeting terrorists, the situation was morally complex, as not all rebels associated with Al-Qaeda were necessarily terrorists. The 4chan community's actions resulted in real bloodshed, raising ethical questions about their involvement in the conflict.

- A basket weaving image board used OSINT and [sky patterns to figure out where a flag is.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4chan-does-first-good-thing-pulls-off-the-heist-of-the-century1/)

In 2017, 4chan users managed to track down and replace Shia LaBeouf's "He Will Not Divide Us" protest flag. Using only the live-stream footage of the flag, they analyzed flight patterns, star positions, and a tweet to locate the flag in Greeneville, Tennessee. A local troll then honked his car horn until the sound was picked up on the live-stream, pinpointing the exact location. The flag was replaced with a Trump hat, marking the end of this elaborate trolling operation.

### How to OSINT:

- Gather information about yourself, become your own threat actor; use the tools below and come up with your own conclusions. Use people search engines and public data about yourself and most importantly don't overshare on the internet or have such a large footprint.

## Tools
OSINT tools can access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines. Be mindful as some info can be out of date or incorrect such as:

- Phone number
- Email
- Address
- IP (Dunno if anyone REALLY uses that but will list)

Anyhow, here are some tools I use:

### Word spinners
- [Article spinner](https://free-article-spinner.com/)
- [Another article spinner](https://www.rewritertools.com/article-spinner)
- [Article rewriter](https://seotoolstation.com/article-rewriter), this one keeps SEO in mind for rankings; after a few tries it WILL ask for a login, use TOR to bypass.

### SEO Tools
[Here's a really good site, I'd recommend using TOR browser to bypass the login page after a few tries](https://seotoolstation.com/).

***DISCLAIMER: Cock.li may be having issues:***

After:

My fellow r*t*rds: cock.li has not "shut down". You may need to read more than the first line.
Anyone suggesting you migrate your account to Gmail, Yahoo, Proton, etc. should not have been using cock.li in the first place. Normal$!gs get off my f*!#ing board.
Feel free to migrate, I don't have any good suggestions though. Try that on Proton!
PW changes and maybe registration will be back within a couple days.

Before:

LIBERTY CANARY

Date updated: See the PGP Signed Version

Cock.li is in 100% control of all of its hardware, and the service is still operating normally. The website (account registration+pw change) is currently offline.

Cock.li will shut down before becoming complicit in crimes against its own user base under duress of any government or organization.

Cock.li is not under duress of any government or organization.

I'd probably recommend using something other than cock.li; use any domain from cock.li and use a different email service provider. However, if you decide to use cock.li, you can check out how to enable it in the given link.
